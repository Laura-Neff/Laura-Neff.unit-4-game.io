# Laura-Neff.unit-4-game.io
This project includes is designed with html, CSS, and javascript files, as well as JQuery and the developer tool Bootstrap to design the website. 
It codes a website that serves as a platform for a game coded in javascript. When the website loads, a random number is generated on the screen,
which represents the amount of money that the user has to pay in taxes to MemeCity, the world the user has been transported to.
The user is also given 4 pictures of memes each with different values that change with each round of the game, ranging from 19-120 inclusive (which are hidden to the user). 
The goal of the user is, by observation and practice, to figure out the values of each meme so that the user can match his/her total score with the random number.
If the user goes above the random number's value (pays more than the required taxes and goes into debt), a loss is recorded. 
If the user does match his/her score with the random number, a win is recorded.
With each loss or win, a new round starts and the game is restarted.
This project showcases how to use JQuery callback methods, as well as how to use Bootstrap to make a website mobile responsive.
